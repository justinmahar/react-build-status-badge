 * See the documentation: [BuildStatusBadge](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-build-status-badge/)
 *
 * A BuildStatusBadge is a React component that allows you to include a real-time build status badge on your site.
 *
 * Just paste in your status badge Markdown and you're ready to go.
 *
 * It features automatic reloading (every 5 seconds by default) and uses query param cache busting to prevent client-side caching. This means your badge automatically updates on the page in real-time as the status changesâ€”no clearing the cache or refreshing the page required.
 *
 * See the [props section](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-build-status-badge/?path=/story/components-buildstatusbadge--page#props) for more options.
