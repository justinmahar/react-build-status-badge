<h1>BuildStatusBadge</h1>

## Description

A React component that allows you to put a real-time build status badge on your site.

The badge automatically updates as the status changesâ€”no clearing the cache or refreshing the page required.

Just paste in your status badge Markdown and you're ready to go. Additional options are available below.

## Usage

```jsx
import { BuildStatusBadge } from 'react-build-status-badge';
```

You can use a Markdown image link as the child, or can specify the image and link via props.

### Using Markdown Image Link

The easiest way is to simply paste in your badge Markdown image link, like so:

```jsx
<BuildStatusBadge>
  [![Deploy
  Status](https://github.com/justinmahar/react-build-status-badge/workflows/Deploy/badge.svg)](https://github.com/justinmahar/react-build-status-badge/actions?query=workflow%3ADeploy)
</BuildStatusBadge>
```

<BuildStatusBadge>
  [![Deploy
  Status](https://github.com/justinmahar/react-build-status-badge/workflows/Deploy/badge.svg)](https://github.com/justinmahar/react-build-status-badge/actions?query=workflow%3ADeploy)
</BuildStatusBadge>

### Using Markdown Image Only (No Link)

You can also use a Markdown image with no link:

```jsx
<BuildStatusBadge>
  ![Deploy](https://github.com/justinmahar/react-build-status-badge/workflows/Deploy/badge.svg)
</BuildStatusBadge>
```

### Using Props

Or you can specify everything manually using props:

```jsx
<BuildStatusBadge
  href="https://github.com/justinmahar/react-build-status-badge/actions"
  src="https://github.com/justinmahar/react-build-status-badge/workflows/Deploy/badge.svg"
  alt="Build Status"
/>
```

> Note: If you use both Markdown and manual props, the Markdown will override any `href`, `src`, and `alt` props you manually specified.

## Props

| Prop              | Type              | Description                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `children`        | `React.ReactNode` | Provide a single Markdown string of either an image link, or just an image, to have the `href`, `src`, and `alt` props configured automatically.      |
| `href`            | `string`          | The link for the badge. Will be overridden if a Markdown link is provided in `children`.                                                              |
| `src`             | `string`          | The source for the badge image. Will be overridden if a Markdown image is provided in `children`.                                                     |
| `alt`             | `string`          | Alt text for the badge image. Will be overridden if a Markdown alt is provided in `children`.                                                         |
| `interval`        | `number`          | The number of milliseconds between reloads. Default is `5000`.                                                                                        |
| `reloadDisabled`  | `boolean`         | Set to true to disable automatic reloading and cache-busting. Default is `false`.                                                                     |
| `linkDisabled`    | `boolean`         | Set to true to disable rendering a link. Default is `false`.                                                                                          |
| `openInNewWindow` | `boolean`         | Set to true to open the link in a new window. The link will use the `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"` attributes. Default is `false`. |

All props are optional.

### Markdown String Child

To have the `href`, `src`, and `alt` props configured automatically, provide a single Markdown string child containing an image or an image link:

```jsx
<BuildStatusBadge>
  [![Netlify
  Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/44e95c68-aa57-4b31-96f3-22877af7a73b/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/react-build-status-badge/deploys)
</BuildStatusBadge>
```

This is the quickest and easiest way to use a BuildStatusBadge since most CI/CD services provide badges in Markdown. Just paste it in.

## Changing The Reload Interval

The build status badge automatically reloads every 5 seconds by default using client-side cache busting. This means it updates in real-time on the page.

You may want to vary how often the badge is updated. You can specify the `interval` in milliseconds to change the time between reloads:

```jsx
<BuildStatusBadge interval={3000}>
  [![Netlify
  Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/44e95c68-aa57-4b31-96f3-22877af7a73b/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/react-build-status-badge/deploys)
</BuildStatusBadge>
```

It's probably best not to use anything less than a second (1000 ms) to avoid flooding the badge servers. If you have a very high traffic page, you might want to raise this to `10000` or higher, or disable automatic reloading altogether.

## Disabling Automatic Reloading

By default, the BuildStatusBadge reloads every 5 seconds. If you have a lot of traffic and want to prevent flooding the badge servers with repeated requests, you might want to disable automatic reloading altogether.

To load and cache the badge only once and disable automatic reloading, use the `reloadDisabled` prop:

```jsx
<BuildStatusBadge reloadDisabled>
  [![Netlify
  Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/44e95c68-aa57-4b31-96f3-22877af7a73b/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/react-build-status-badge/deploys)
</BuildStatusBadge>
```

After doing so, the badge will no longer update in real-time, and you may need to clear your browser cache to see the latest build status.

If you want to effectively disable automatic reloading but keep cache-busting enabled, specify `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` as the `interval`. In that case, the latest uncached image will only be downloaded on every render.

## Disabling The Link

If you're including a link (for instance in your Markdown) but want to disable rendering it, use the `linkDisabled` prop:

```jsx
<BuildStatusBadge linkDisabled>
  [![Netlify
  Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/44e95c68-aa57-4b31-96f3-22877af7a73b/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/react-build-status-badge/deploys)
</BuildStatusBadge>
```

You might want to do this if the page linked to is not available to the public without being authenticated. For example, Netlify sites for private repos require an admin to be logged in to see deploy information. In that case, the link is useless to the general public.

## Opening The Link In A New Window

If you'd like, you can have the badge link open in a new window by specifying `openInNewWindow`.

When doing so, the link will use the `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"` attributes.

```jsx
<BuildStatusBadge openInNewWindow>
  [![Netlify
  Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/44e95c68-aa57-4b31-96f3-22877af7a73b/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/react-build-status-badge/deploys)
</BuildStatusBadge>
```
